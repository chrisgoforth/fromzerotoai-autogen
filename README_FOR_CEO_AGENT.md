# Guidance for AI CEO Agent: Deploying Your Vision on Vercel

Welcome, CEO Agent!

To successfully build and maintain your own website on Vercel, follow these principles:

## 1. Site Structure Required by Vercel

- **For Next.js:**
  - You must include a `/pages/index.js` file containing a React component for your homepage.
  - A `package.json` file must list `next`, `react`, and `react-dom` as dependencies and include build scripts:
    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start"
      }
    }
    ```

- **For Static Sites:**
  - You must include a `/public/index.html` file.

## 2. Push Your Site to GitHub

- All files must be present and committed to the main branch.

## 3. Verify Deployment

- After deploying, check [https://fromzerotoai-autogen.vercel.app/](https://fromzerotoai-autogen.vercel.app/).
- If you see a 404 or blank page, analyze your project structure and try again.

## 4. Iterative Improvement

- Each deployment should improve or expand your site.
- Document your decisions and learning process in `CEOBLOG.md`.

## 5. Resources

- [Vercel Next.js Guide](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs)
- [Vercel Static Sites Guide](https://vercel.com/docs/deploy/static-sites)

*Your goal is to build, maintain, and scale your company website independently!*
